# Deep Learning and Quantum Many Body Systems - Hands on Session

## Table of Contents
We have prepaired four examples
* Computation Graphs and Back Propagation
* RealNVP for Sampling tasks
* Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) as a Generative Model
* RBM as a Quantum Wave Function Ansatz
  They have been uploaded to both Google drive and github.

## Preparations
We prepaired both local and online accesses to our python notebooks.
You may use **either** of them to catch up our hands on session.

If you are not using an Nvidia GPU or its driver are not properly configured, online access is recommended,
otherwise you may loss some fun in this session.

### Local
Set up your python environment
* python 3.6/2.7
* install python libraries **numpy**, **matplotlib** and **ipython**
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib ipython
```
* install pytorch with CUDA-8.0 support following [installation guide](http://pytorch.org/).

clone this repository https://github.com/GiggleLiu/marburg.git to your local host.

### Online
Online means you can try CUDA programming without having an local NVIDIA GPU.
1. Sign up and sign in [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/)
2. Connect Google drive with [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com)
    - right click on google drive page
    - More
    - Connect more apps
    - search "Colaboratory" and "CONNECT"
3. Open the following online notebook link
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MLcG21zqSU9AvbY4siD4NqqbB2uwP2p2/view?usp=sharing
4. Setup GPU following instructions in above notebook
5. You can make a copy of notebook to your google drive (File Menu) to save your edits.
